Familiarizing with different algorithms applied in genomics for analyzing DNA sequencing data using Python.
Starting with exact and approximate matching when searching for a pattern in the text/genome (naive exact, Boyer-Moore, Index-assisted, and pigeonhole principle).
Algorithms used in read alignment using edit distance problems and global and local alignment problems.
Algorithms and strategies to solve genome assembly problems (overlap graph, brute-force, greedy shortest common superstring, DeBruijn graphs and Eulerian walks)
