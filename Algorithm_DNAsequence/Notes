Familarizing to different algorithms applied in genomics for analyzing DNA sequencing data using python.
Starting with exact and approximate matching when searching for a pattern in the text/genome (naive exact, Boyer-Moore, Index-assisted, and pegionhole principle).
Algorithms used in read alignment using both edit distance problem and global and local alignment problem.
